# Python
Master Python Language
Python (Monty python named earlier) developed by Guido van Rossum
Python open- Source and Interpreted Language(Software that is a high-level language)
Python updated version can be from python.org
It is Open Source ( source code is not in encrypted format)
Python is interpreted language because it converts python source code to machine understandable language.
C++ and Python is multi-paradigm programming language.
Python language does not focus on readability of code.
Boilerplate Code is more in other languages.



# Python Features
- Software Quality
- Developer Productivity
- Program Portability
- Support Library


# Python Timeline
-Python 1.5
-Python 1.6
-Python 2.0 versions
-Python 3.0 versions

# python readability
-this differentiate programmers and data scientists

# comments
- block level comments
- inline comments
- document string/docstring
  
# Data Types
-variables

# Operators
-symbol to perform mathematical or logical manipulations..

# Flow Control
- if , else if ,else
- loop

# string
- immutable
- enclosed in single or double quotation marks
- concatenated with the +sign
- string are repeated with *sign

# Data types of Python 
# List
- list is mutable i.e can be modified
- list is an ordered collection
- list is a sequence i.e collection of data one after the other
- we can use indexing in list i.e an specific object can be located
- list is dynamic i.e grow and shrink in runtime
- list can hold different types of elements
- list can be nested to arbitary depth

# Tuple
- tuple is immutable
- tuple is an ordered collection
- tuple is a sequence
- tuple is not dynamic
- It can hold different type of elements
- Tuple can be nested to any arbitary depth

# Set
- Set is mutable
- Set is unordered collection and dosn't perserve insertion order
- Set isn't a sequence
- Set is dynamic
- It can hold diff type of immutable objects 
- In Set values can't be duplicate

# Dictionary
- Dict is mutable
- Dict is unordered collection but it perserve insertion order
- Dict isn't a sequence
- Dict is dynamic
- It can hold diff type of elements as key  or value 
- Dict can be nested to any arbitary depth
- Dict can use only immutable types of obj as its key
- In dict key can't be duplicate
